## Abstract

The term _"Swarm Intelligence"_ is the collective behavior of a combination of many simple individuals, where they operate autonomously. _"Swarm Robotics"_ is the application of swarm intelligence used in collective robotics. This has been a new approach to the coordination of mass of robots that are capable of local communication, decentralized controlling, autonomous and also operations based on biological inspiration senses. In order to achieve the highest effectiveness of swarm robotics applications, virtual reality has been used.

The _Mixed Reality (MR)_ was originally derived from _Virtual Reality (VR)_. When designing MR systems, users are provided with the illusion that digital objects are in the same space as physical ones. Mixed Reality is typically correlated with Virtual Reality by the solutions that have been made to address the problems related in the robotic applications. However, the use of MR was clearly identified as very useful from just only VR implementations by its flexibility, scalability and availability with respect to each implementation.

Testing and experimentation of robotic applications could be made far easier than VR with the significant increase of control over various environmental constraints and limitations. Hence, we combined both the virtual and physical robots, and created a mixed reality swarm robotics platform. Moreover, a web-based simulator was implemented to visualize the movements of robots. Positioning of physical robots was vital when visualizing. Thus an overhead camera was used to identify the positions of the robots using the image processing with OpenCV and represent them on the simulator.

## Introduction

#### Swarm Robotics

Over the past few decades technology has been evolving rapidly in so many aspects and fields to reach out to the human population in a more user friendly manner. With these technology developments, one such industry that took a huge leap with an advanced improvement is the field of robotics. Even in robotics, swarm robotics has been a major breakthrough.

The term _"Swarm Intelligence"_ refers to sophisticated collective behavior that is being emerged from the combination of many simple individuals, each operating autonomously. It consists of a biologically inspired emphasis based on the emergence of global behavior, also on decentralized local control and local communication. _"Swarm Robotics"_ is the application of swarm intelligence used in collective robotics.

#### Virtual Reality and Mixed Reality

Virtual reality is another major part of the technical field which is experienced through sensory stimuli such as sights and sounds provided by a computer and partially determines what happens in the 3D computer-generated environment.

Virtual reality describes the simulation of a synthetic environment similar to the actual environment. The term “virtual reality” was introduced by computer scientist, Jaron Lanier for the first time and he founded the first company (“VLP Research”) to develop VR products like VR goggles, joystick, data gloves, and “Bird 3D” electromagnetic tracker

Milgram’s scale represents the real environment and the virtual environment at the ends while introducing a new concept known as Mixed Reality (MR) in the middle. According to Milgram’s diagram, there are two broad areas, Augmented Reality (AR) and Augmented Virtuality (AV) which belong to the MR. However, the medium that represented a combination of real and virtual environments mostly known as AR rather than MR.
